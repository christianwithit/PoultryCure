# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Google Gemini API into the PoultryCure application to provide AI-powered poultry disease diagnosis through both symptom analysis and image recognition. The integration will replace the current mock API implementation with real multimodal AI capabilities, enabling more accurate disease identification and treatment recommendations.

## Glossary

- **Gemini_API**: Google's multimodal AI service that can process both text and images
- **PoultryCure_App**: The React Native mobile application for poultry disease diagnosis
- **Diagnosis_Service**: The service layer responsible for communicating with external AI APIs
- **Disease_Database**: The local collection of poultry disease information used for context
- **Multimodal_Analysis**: AI analysis that combines both text symptoms and image data

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a poultry farmer, I want to get AI-powered disease diagnosis from symptoms, so that I can receive more accurate and reliable health assessments for my birds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits symptom descriptions, THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL send the symptoms to Gemini_API with disease context
2. WHEN Gemini_API returns analysis results, THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL parse the response into structured diagnosis data
3. THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL include the local Disease_Database as context in API requests
4. WHEN API requests fail, THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL provide fallback responses using local disease matching
5. THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL validate API responses before returning results to the application

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a poultry farmer, I want to upload images of sick birds for AI analysis, so that I can get visual diagnosis assistance when symptoms are unclear.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image, THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL convert the image to base64 format for API transmission
2. WHEN sending image analysis requests, THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL include both image data and any accompanying symptom text
3. THE Gemini_API SHALL analyze the image for visual signs of poultry diseases
4. WHEN image analysis completes, THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL return structured results including confidence scores
5. THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL handle image processing errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a poultry farmer, I want the AI to provide treatment recommendations based on my local disease database, so that I receive contextually relevant advice for my region.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests, THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL include the complete Disease_Database as context
2. THE Gemini_API SHALL use the provided disease context to generate relevant treatment recommendations
3. WHEN generating responses, THE Gemini_API SHALL prioritize diseases from the provided database
4. THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL ensure API responses follow the existing DiagnosisResult interface structure
5. THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL maintain consistency with existing severity levels and recommendation formats

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure API key management, so that the Gemini API credentials are protected and the application remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE PoultryCure_App SHALL store the Gemini API key in environment variables
2. THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL never expose API keys in client-side code or logs
3. WHEN API requests fail due to authentication, THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL provide clear error messages without exposing credentials
4. THE PoultryCure_App SHALL validate API key presence before attempting requests
5. THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL implement proper error handling for rate limiting and quota exceeded scenarios

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a poultry farmer, I want reliable service with fallback options, so that I can still get diagnosis help even when the AI service is unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Gemini_API is unavailable, THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL automatically fall back to local disease matching
2. THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL implement timeout handling for API requests with maximum 30-second wait time
3. WHEN using fallback mode, THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL clearly indicate to users that local analysis is being used
4. THE Diagnosis_Service SHALL retry failed requests once before falling back to local analysis
5. THE PoultryCure_App SHALL maintain full functionality even when external API services are unavailable
