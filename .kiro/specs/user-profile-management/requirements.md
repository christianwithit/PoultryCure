# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing user authentication and profile management in PoultryCure, a mobile application designed to help poultry farmers diagnose and manage poultry health issues. The current app lacks user authentication, which prevents users from having personalized accounts and accessing their data across devices.

## Glossary

- **PoultryCure_App**: The mobile application system for poultry health diagnosis and management
- **Authentication_System**: The system component responsible for user login, signup, and session management
- **User_Account**: A registered user's account containing credentials and profile information
- **User_Session**: An active authenticated state allowing access to personalized features
- **Profile_Data**: User-specific information including personal details and preferences
- **Account_Credentials**: User login information including email and password
